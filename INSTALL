INSTALL for rb52odim

Daniel Michelson and Peter Rodriguez

This software works with Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x, together with a RAVE 
installation.
RAVE and its packages are found at git.baltrad.eu. 

(As RAVE is currently migrating to Python 3, this package will follow in due 
course.)

Set Makefile dependencies depending on how your RAVE was built. This deals 
specifically with your $RAVEROOT, $PATH, and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment 
variables. These can be collected into a file that can be sourced, especially 
if used by others. For example,
$ source /opt/baltrad/etc/env.rc

Then it should just be a simply matter of make ; make test ; make install

Long version:
